Worldwide, more than 55 million people have dementia, with 10 million more people being diagnosed every year.1 Numerous studies have explored how individuals might be able to minimize their chances of developing dementia by identifying risk factors. The objective of this analysis is to investigate possible correlations between dementia status and factors that can be attributed to either “nature” or “nurture.” Although many health and lifestyle factors were included in this dataset, 3 were chosen for initial analysis in each group; positivity for the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE-ε4), family history, and age for the “nature” category, and education level, smoking status, and physical activity for the “nurture” category.
