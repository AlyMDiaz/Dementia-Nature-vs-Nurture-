Worldwide, more than 55 million people have dementia, with 10 million more people being diagnosed every year.1 Numerous studies have explored how individuals might be able to minimize their chances of developing dementia by identifying risk factors. In this analysis, various lifestyle and health markers are examined for possible correlations with the development of dementia. A total of 6 markers were identified and categorized as either “nature” or “nurture;” the strongest correlations with dementia status were within the “nature” category, although some interesting patterns could be found in the “nurture” category as well. Since so many varied factors exist that could affect the chances of developing dementia, further analysis is needed to take all the complex relationships between these factors into consideration and draw more solid conclusions.
